# Aquarium-Combined-with-YoloV8




## Project Goal

This project aims to use the YOLOv8 deep learning model to detect marine life in an aquarium. The project used 500 training images and 127 validation images.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of real aquarium images containing different types of marine life. The dataset is divided into the following categories:

- Fish: 250 training images, 62 validation images
- Jellyfish: 100 training images, 25 validation images
- Penguin: 50 training images, 15 validation images
- Puffin: 50 training images, 15 validation images
- Shark: 50 training images, 15 validation images
- Starfish: 50 training images, 15 validation images
- Stingray: 50 training images, 15 validation images


## Model Training

The model was trained using the Darknet framework. Training was conducted over 200 iterations.

## Results

The model's performance is shown in the following table:

Category	  Precision Recall
Fish	         0.826	0.817
Jellyfish	     0.942	0.935
Penguin	       0.688	0.679
Puffin	       0.682	0.673
Shark	         0.745	0.736
Starfish	     0.782	0.773
Stingray	     0.822	0.813
All Classes    0.784	0.775
Future Work

The project's future works are as follows:

- Increase the size of the dataset
- Increase the complexity of the model
- Evaluate the model's performance in different aquarium environments

## Conclusion

This project has shown that the YOLOv8 deep learning model can be used to detect marine life in an aquarium. The project's future works aim to further improve the model's performance.
